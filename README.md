thanks for the editor

The default tapping term of 200ms seems to be the best not too slow that I would need to wait for lot of time for single key press, not too fast that I cannot tap the key 2 times in that window

In the utils layer I am not sure about the csa or sca, the main reason for thinking about csa order is that it would make any combos, with sca order it makes the combos I have in macos easier, IG lets go with sca, and use that order from now on

For some reason while trying out in macos (donot have linux setup for now) shifting to ws7,8 are not registering may be lets try with more tapping term
